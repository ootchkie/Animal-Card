			<p>Tigers are the largest of all cat species and easily recognizable by their
iconic stripes.  Known as Apex predators, these cats are Powerful and 
efficient hunters with an anatomy designed for eating meat.  Tigers play
an important roll in natural population control, but are being forced out
of their natural habitats by human encroachment and extermination.  
Despite human fears, Tigers have a long history with humanity.  They
appear on many flags, coats of arms, as modern mascot and in the legends
and histories of many cultures around the world.  They are frequently and
famously portrayed in many well known movies and films  Facing possible 
extinction, the plight of Tigers today as a species is grim.
Only 6 subspecies of the animal are left and their numbers in the wild are
reduced to a low number, estimates are for appx. 3,500 total.  That is bad.</p>
